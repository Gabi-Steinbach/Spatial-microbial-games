# Code repository for publication "Phase separation and coexistence in spatial coordination games between microbes"
This repository contains code and data associated with the manuscript titled "Phase separation and coexistence in spatial coordination games between microbes". 

## Running the code
The code for simulation and figure generation code is a Jupyter notebookthat uses Python 3. You will need python packages numpy, numba, matplotlib, scipy. 

## Folder descriptions

### Code
The folder contains three files with code to simulate spatial games and conduct spatial analysis for three cases: symmetric, small asymmetric, and large asymmetric potential

### Data
Output folder for simulation data for symmetric, small asymmetric, and large asymmetric spatial games generated by python notebooks.

### Figures
Output folder for figures generated by jupyter notebooks.
